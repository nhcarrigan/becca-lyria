**We will NOT be shutting Becca down.**

At this time, Becca will continue to run indefinitely, with her current feature set. The only updates she will receive, however, are the updates necessary to maintain functionality (e.g. breaking changes in the Discord API).

If there is a feature you would like implemented, you are welcome to [commission us in our server](<https://chat.nhcarrigan.com>) or [create a PR](<https://becca.nhcarrigan.com>).

Thank you for all of your support and understanding. ðŸ’œ

Click the \`Acknowledge\` button below to continue using Becca.`;
