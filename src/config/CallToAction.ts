Hey there, I'm Naomi Carrigan, the developer of Becca Lyria. Becca has been serving over 300 communities for the last 3 years.

Unfortunately, the amount of time and energy required to maintain her is not sustainable. Without your support, we'll ultimately need to retire Becca.

If you are able to, please consider donating to help us keep Becca running. You can see the options for doing so by clicking the \`Donate\` button below.

Without sufficient financial support, Becca will stop receiving code updates on <t:1698854400:D>, and will be shut down on <t:1701450000:D>.

If you have any questions, feel free to join our [support server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com).

Click the \`Acknowledge\` button below to continue using Becca.`;
